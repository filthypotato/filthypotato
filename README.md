<h2 align="center">🛠 What I Build</h2>

<p align="center">
  I like creating small, focused tools and projects that help me learn new skills.<br/>
  Most of what I build falls into these categories:
</p>

<p align="center">
  🖧 <strong>Networking projects</strong> — sockets, servers, scanners<br/>
  🔐 <strong>Cybersecurity tools</strong> — recon, enumeration, automation<br/>
  📦 <strong>Utility apps</strong> — budgeting, inventory, data handling<br/>
  🎮 <strong>Game experiments</strong> — SDL, console games, C++ mini-projects<br/>
  🏗 <strong>Homelab tooling</strong> — Docker, scripts, dashboards, automations
</p>

<p align="center">
  Most of my repos are simple experiments, learning projects, or ideas I wanted to try.<br/>
  Feel free to explore anything on my profile — I'm always building something new.
