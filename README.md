<h1 align="center">Cybersecurity Student - Developer - Homelab Nerd</h1>

<p align="center">
  I’m usually building something - or breaking it and fixing it again.<br/>
  Tools, servers, experiments, little games, automations… repeat x20.

## About Me

- Cybersecurity student focused on networks, automation, and secure systems  
- I write C++ for fun, which probably says something about me  
- Learning Pyton for automation to level up that tool belt 
- Homelab addict running Unraid, Docker stacks, VMs, and too many services  
- I like building things from scratch just to understand how they work  
- Interested in LoRa, SDR, signals, Flipper Zero, and hardware tinkering  
- Working toward a career in cybersecurity engineering  
- Constantly experimenting and learning (usually the hard way)

## What I Build

<p>
  <strong>Networking projects</strong> - sockets, chat servers, scanners<br/>
  <strong>Security tooling</strong> - recon, enumeration, automation helpers<br/>
  <strong>Utility apps</strong> - small tools that solve problems I actually have<br/>
  <strong>Game experiments</strong> - SDL3, console games, algorithms, Unity, UE5<br/>
  <strong>Homelab automation</strong> - Docker, dashboards, scripts, monitoring
</p>

<p>
  Most of my repos are learning projects or experiments.<br/>
  Some are rough, some are broken, some not finished, but all of them taught me something.
